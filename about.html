        <h3> &nbsp;&nbsp; 1.What is Fitness? </h3>
        <p>Fitness is any kind of activity that keeps the body in a certain state and stimulates various body systems.
            On the other hand, health involves everybody system and can only be achieved through a healthy lifestyle.For
            instance, if a client of mine tells me that they haven't eaten well, ignored the amount of fat in their
            food, and mostly eaten processed foods, all the exercise in the world won't help.
        </p>

        <h3> &nbsp;&nbsp; 2.Why Fitness? </h3>
        <p>Chemical damage, weakening of the immune system, and depleted food weakness can't be fixed by exercise. Good
            health can only be supported by good nutrition. Fitness, of course, can help with health and WILL help
            improve health if it is a way of life. The majority of our health is the result of thousands of daily
            dietary choices. Ask yourself this straightforward question as you progress on your personal health journey
            or just get back on track:Am I just fit, or am I on the path to health and fitness?If your response is "just
            fit," you might want to try incorporating other aspects of wellness into a more comprehensive plan that
            focuses on spiritual, mental, emotional, and physical health together.</p>

        <h3> &nbsp;&nbsp; 3.Benefit of Health and Fitness. </h3>
        <p>One of the most important things you can do for your health is engage in regular physical activity.Being
            physically active can help you manage your weight, improve your brain health, lower your risk of disease,
            strengthen your bones and muscles, and make it easier to do things you normally do.
            There are some health benefits for adults who sit less and engage in any amount of moderate-to-vigorous
            physical activity. Physical activity is one of only a few lifestyle choices that has such a significant
            impact on health.</p>
