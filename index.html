                <p>Exercise is essential for maintaining fitness, improving overall health, and assisting in the
                    prevention of obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.According to surveys carried out by
                    the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 61.5% of children between the ages of nine and
                    thirteen do not engage in any form of organized physical activity, such as sports or dance classes,
                    and 22.6% do not engage in physical activity in their free time.The American Obesity Association
                    estimates that 15% of children and adolescents aged six to 19 are obese and 30% of children and
                    adolescents aged six to 19 are overweight.</p>

                <h2 class="text-center">Yoga</h2>
                <p>Yoga is a spiritual, mental, and physical practice from ancient India.The practice was actually
                    passed down from teacher to student long before this book was written, and the wise man Patanjali
                    codified it in his Yoga Sutras around 400 C.E.This used to be done one-on-one, but group classes
                    have become the norm since yoga became popular in the West in the 20th century.
                    The Sanskrit root yuj, which means "to yoke" or "to unite," is where the word "yoga" gets its name.
                    The practice aims to unite the individual self and universal consciousness as well as the mind,
                    body, and spirit. A feeling of spiritual awakening is brought about by this union, which tends to
                    neutralize ego-driven thoughts and actions.</p>

                <p>You get the nutrients your body needs to function properly from a well-balanced diet.Your body is
                    more prone to illness, infection, fatigue, and low performance if you don't eat well.
                    Healthy food insufficiency can lead to growth and development issues, poor academic performance, and
                    frequent infections in children.
                    Additionally, they may develop bad eating habits that may last into adulthood.
                    They will also be more likely to develop obesity and a number of metabolic syndrome diseases, such
                    as type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, if they don't exercise.... </p>
